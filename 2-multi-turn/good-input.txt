Title: Unexpected ⁠undefined result when using TypeScript with an array method
Question:
I'm working with TypeScript and have encountered an unexpected issue when using the ⁠map method on an array. The goal is to create a new array where each element is doubled. However, I'm getting ⁠undefined values in the result instead of the expected doubled numbers.
Here is the code:
function doubleArrayElements(arr: number[]): number[] {
  return arr.map((element) => {
    element * 2;
  });
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubledNumbers = doubleArrayElements(numbers);
console.log(doubledNumbers);
Expected Behavior:
The ⁠doubledNumbers array should contain the doubled values of the input array:
[2, 4, 6, 8]
Actual Behavior:
The ⁠doubledNumbers array contains ⁠undefined values:
[undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined]
What I've Tried:
I've checked the function to ensure the ⁠map method is being used correctly, but I can't seem to find the issue. I'm not sure why the function returns ⁠undefined values instead of the doubled numbers. Any insights would be appreciated.
